The code shown here combines principal component analysis, one-vs-all multiclass classification, and a quantum-enhanced support vector machine simulation in order to classify between x-rays of normal lungs, viral pneumonia lungs, and bacterial pneumonia lungs. 

Motivation:

Pneumonia is very common in children, affecting 150-156 million children under the age of 5 each year. Symptoms of pneumonia include a wet cough, fever, shortness of breath, and sharp pain in the chest.This is due to the buildup of fluid in the lungs. For viral pneumonia the fluid is typically spread throughout the lungs, while for bacterial pneumonia the fluid is consolidated into only one of the lobes of the lungs.

Performing quick and accurate diagnosis is vital in making sure children receive the correct treatment. It is for this reason that our team decided to develop a quantum machine learning algorithm to help diagnose pneumonia.
